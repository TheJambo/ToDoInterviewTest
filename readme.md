# Bugs to Create

* Editing an item to be empty doesn't delete the item.
* Shouldn't be able to save blank items
* "Complete All" button uncompletes all complete ones if there's a mix of statuses.


## Current Bugs
* Spelling error (toodo) in instruction text at the bottom of the screen
* Spelling Error in default "What need's to be done?" Text (apostrophe)
* Not counting the number of items properly (-1)
* Active should have a capital 'A' for consistency
* Clear Completed button doesn't work
* Two 404 errors in the console
* With enough refreshes, the Symbol Ã (A with Tilde) will appear instead of the
 X and â (A with carat/a-circumflex) will appear instead of the "Check All"
 button.
* Undoing "Complete All" takes two clicks
* Delete Task button has a tooltip of "TODO:REMOVE THIS EVENTUALLY"
* When window is made smaller, everything looks fine except the title overlaps itself
* Trimmed items will expand to their original state when editing
* After creating a new item, the "New Item" entry box has 3 spaces in it


## Improvement Suggestions
* Not using HTTPS
* When a large item is created, the "Complete" button is vertically centered, but the delete button is at the bottom.
* Down arrow as "Complete All" is unintuitive
* When adding a new item, page should navigate back to the "All" or "Active" tab to see the new item.

## Worthwhile observations
* It trims spaces at the start and the end and only allows a single space otherwise.
